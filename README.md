# Virtual Key Codes for Mac OS Catalina
Often, programmers have to know the key code for a particular key on the keyboard in order to accomplish some task. Unfortunately, some of this information was difficult for me to find on the internet. Therefore I made a keyboard layout that types the key code of every key that is pressed. (Note this does not work for the arrow keys). Then I took three screenshots using a keyboard editing program on Mac OS.

The screenshots are could be useful for Mac OS programmers who need to look up key codes. The diagnostic keyboard layout may be useful as a quick way to enter a key code without looking it up. Just switch to the diagnostic keyboard layout, and type one key, and an integer will be typed in. 

## How to install the keyboard layout:

1. Copy the "diagnosticKeyCode.keylayout" file to your "~/Library/Keyboard Layouts" folder 
2. and logout, 
3. then log back in.
4. Open System Preferences.
5. Open keyboard preferences, 
6. look under "Other" and install the "diagnosticKeyCode" layout.
